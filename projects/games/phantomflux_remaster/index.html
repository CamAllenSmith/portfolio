        <section header="Complex Dialogue Trees">
            <video muted autoplay loop><source src="dialogue.webm" type="video/webm"></video>
            <p>The new system put in place allows for multiple paths of dialogue to be taken. People who aren't interested can take shortcuts out of the dialogue while people who are interested can stick around for some jokes.</p>

       <section header="New Lighting System">
            <video muted autoplay loop><source src="lighting.webm" type="video/webm"></video>
            <p>I created my own lighting system using nothing but HTML5 Canvas. This was done using a grayscale overlay canvas that asks as a lighting mask for the game's main canvas.</p>

        <section header="Menu Tabs">
            <video muted autoplay loop><source src="menu.webm" type="video/webm"></video>
            <p>A new user interface was added that can be opened by pressing "B". The Inventory tab displays the player's equipment and inventory, while the Spellbook and Stats tabs show the player's spells and stats respectively. This was still under development so it doesn't look very pretty, but the functionality is there.</p>

        <section header="Equipment">
            <video muted autoplay loop><source src="equipment.webm" type="video/webm"></video>
            <p>There are currently two sets of equipment. Leather armor and a bow for archer style gameplay, and plate armor and a sword for knight style gameplay. The armor can easily be mix-matched using the equipment menu.</p>

            <p>Previously, Phantom Flux was focused more on cool items with a few default abilities. In order to give the game a more fantasy feel, I wanted to work on adding a few spells. The spells implemented so far include a basic fireball, a ghost teleport, and "Ether Blade".</p>

            <img src = "map2.png">
            <p>The original Phantom Flux used an infinite world generation method, but I decided I'd be better off making some pre-made levels after I learned how to use <a href = "http://www.mapeditor.org/">Tiled Map Editor</a> and import JSON files using AJAX.</p>
