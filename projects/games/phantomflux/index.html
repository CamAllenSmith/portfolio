    <p>I made tons of different weapon types, including the phaser disc, explosive disc, shortbow, longbow, longsword, shuriken, and dragonspear. The enemies that were implemented are spiders, imps, and ice golems.</p>
    <video loop autoplay><source src="/media/projects/games/phantom_flux_old/crit.webm" type="video/webm"></video>
    <p>Each weapon has it's own crit chance and crit multiplier which effects the player's stats. Here you can see the player critting with the longsword which deals 2x damage.</p>

    <p>One of the main features of this game is the infinite world generation. This is done using a "chunk" system similar to minecraft. To aid in adventuring the world, the player has a worlf form which grants increased movement speed at the cost of not being able to attack.</p>

    <p>Probably the coolest weapon of them all is the phaser disc. This was the first weapon I came up with, and it works perfectly with the players ability to stop time. When the player holds down a directional key, the phaser disc will stay in position, and when the key is released it will return to the player. When the player is in phantom form, he can create multiple copies of himself, allowing him to create a path for the disc to follow, allowing for some crazy awesome combos.</p>

    <video loop autoplay><source src="/media/projects/games/phantom_flux_old/combo2.webm" type="video/webm"></video>
    <p>With the phantom form ability and explosive disc, the possibilities of combos are endless.</p>
    <header>Various Arrow Types</header>
    <hr>
    <video loop autoplay><source src="/media/projects/games/phantom_flux_old/arrows.webm" type="video/webm"></video>
    <p>There are two different bows to choose from. The shortbow which is fast and low damage, and the longbow which has a cast time but packs a punch. Along with these bow types are various arrow types, including the standard arrow, concussive arrow (slows enemies) and the splitter arrow which splits into 3 lasers that all shoot out and then return to the center point, resulting in tons of damage.</p>
    <header>Stats, Equipment, Time and Weather System</header>

    <video loop autoplay><source src="/media/projects/games/phantom_flux_old/stats.webm" type="video/webm"></video>
    <p>The character menu displays the player's stats along with currently equipped weapons and the current time and weather. The player can have two weapons equipped at a time, a melee and ranged weapon, along with the associated ammo type.</p>
    <header>Quest and Dialogue System</header>
    <hr>
    <video loop autoplay><source src="/media/projects/games/phantom_flux_old/quest.webm" type="video/webm"></video>
    <p>This game is equipped with a fully functioning quest and dialogue system. The quests that have been added are currently very simple, such as shooting 5 targets, but the system is ready for more quests to be added. When a quest is completed, the player is rewarded with money and experience, and it allows the player to pick up new quests. For example, when the player completes the quest that has him shoot 5 targets, the follow-up quest requires him to shoot 5 targets within a very small time period (2 seconds or so) which introduces him to the phantom form ability that slows down time.</p>
